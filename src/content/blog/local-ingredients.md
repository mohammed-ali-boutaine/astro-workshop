# 5 Local Ingredients That Inspire Our Menu

_Published on January 10, 2025 by Chef David Thompson_

At Sndwch, we believe the best flavors come from our own backyard. Working with local farmers and producers not only ensures the freshest ingredients but also tells the story of our community on every plate. Here are five local ingredients that continuously inspire our menu.

## 1. Heritage Tomatoes from Sunset Valley Farm

Just 20 miles outside the city, Maria and Giuseppe grow the most incredible heirloom tomatoes we've ever tasted. These aren't your grocery store tomatoes - they're ugly, misshapen, and absolutely perfect.

**What makes them special:**

- Over 12 varieties including Cherokee Purples and Green Zebras
- Harvested at peak ripeness (not shipped green)
- Grown in mineral-rich soil that adds complexity
- Available June through October

**How we use them:** Our summer tomato sandwich features three varieties, flaky sea salt, fresh basil, and our house-made aioli on sourdough. It's pure summer on bread.

## 2. Wild Mushrooms from Forager's Friend

Every Tuesday, Jake arrives with a trunk full of wild mushrooms foraged from the surrounding forests. The variety changes with the seasons, keeping our menu exciting and unpredictable.

**Seasonal highlights:**

- **Spring:** Morels and ramps
- **Summer:** Chanterelles and oyster mushrooms
- **Fall:** Porcini and hen-of-the-woods
- **Winter:** Dried varieties and cultivated shiitakes

**Chef's favorite:** Our wild mushroom melt changes every week based on Jake's finds. Last week featured butter-saut√©ed chanterelles with aged gruyere on our house-made brioche.

## 3. Artisan Cheeses from Blue Ridge Creamery

Sarah's small-batch cheeses are made from milk from her own grass-fed goats and cows. Each wheel tells a story of the season and what the animals were eating.

**Our must-haves:**

- **Moonlight:** A soft-ripened goat cheese with a bloomy rind
- **Valley Gold:** An aged cheddar that's sharp and nutty
- **Herb Garden:** Fresh chevre rolled in garden herbs
- **Smoky Blue:** A blue cheese cold-smoked over applewood

**Menu magic:** These cheeses rotate through our grilled cheese special and cheese boards, often paired with local honey and preserves.

## 4. Sourdough Cultures from The Old Mill

Tom maintains sourdough starters that are over 100 years old, passed down through generations of bakers. The complex flavors develop from wild yeasts native to our region.

**What's remarkable:**

- Some starters date back to the 1800s
- Fed daily with locally milled flour
- Each starter has its own personality and flavor profile
- Naturally fermented over 3-5 days

**Our signature:** Every sandwich starts with Tom's sourdough - tangy, chewy, with a perfect crust that holds up to our heartiest fillings.

## 5. Cold-Pressed Oils from Olive Branch Orchard

Who knew you could grow olives in our climate? The Peterson family proved it possible with their micro-orchard that produces small batches of exceptional oil.

**Their varieties:**

- **Early Harvest:** Grassy and peppery, perfect for finishing
- **Late Harvest:** Smooth and buttery, ideal for cooking
- **Herb-Infused:** Made with rosemary and thyme from their garden

**Kitchen essential:** We use their oils for everything - drizzling over caprese, making aioli, and as the base for our house vinaigrette.

## Building Relationships, Not Just Menus

Working with local producers means more than just buying ingredients. We visit the farms, understand their growing practices, and plan our menu around their seasons. These relationships inspire creativity and ensure we're serving food with integrity.

**Our seasonal calendar:**

- **Spring:** Fresh herbs, early greens, and young cheeses
- **Summer:** Peak tomatoes, stone fruits, and abundant vegetables
- **Fall:** Hearty mushrooms, aged cheeses, and preserved goods
- **Winter:** Root vegetables, cured meats, and fermented foods

## Taste the Difference

Next time you visit, ask about the story behind your sandwich. Every ingredient has a face, a farm, and a story. That's what makes each bite not just delicious, but meaningful.
