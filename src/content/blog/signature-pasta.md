# How We Make Our Signature Pasta

_Published on January 15, 2025 by Chef Maria Rodriguez_

There's something magical about fresh pasta. The way the dough feels in your hands, the satisfaction of rolling it to the perfect thickness, and that incredible texture when it hits your plate. Today, I'm sharing the secrets behind our signature pasta that keeps customers coming back.

## The Foundation: Our Flour Blend

It all starts with the right flour. We use a carefully crafted blend of:

- **70% Tipo 00 flour** - for that silky smooth texture
- **20% Semolina** - adds structure and that perfect al dente bite
- **10% Ancient grain flour** - brings depth and nutty flavor

## The Process

### 1. Creating the Well

We start by creating a volcano-like well with our flour blend. This traditional technique allows us to gradually incorporate the eggs without making a mess.

### 2. The Egg Magic

Our eggs come from local free-range chickens, and we use exactly:

- 1 whole egg per 100g of flour
- 2 additional egg yolks for richness
- A pinch of sea salt
- A drizzle of our best olive oil

### 3. The Kneading Ritual

This is where the magic happens. We knead for exactly 10 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. The secret? We knead with the heel of our palm, fold, rotate 90 degrees, and repeat.

### 4. The Rest

We wrap our dough in plastic and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes rolling much easier.

### 5. Rolling to Perfection

Using our vintage pasta machine, we roll the dough through progressively thinner settings. The key is to dust with semolina between each pass to prevent sticking.

## Chef's Secret Tips

üî• **Temperature matters**: Keep your workspace cool - warm hands make sticky dough  
ü•ö **Room temperature eggs**: Take eggs out 30 minutes before cooking  
‚è∞ **Don't rush**: Good pasta takes time and patience  
üßÇ **Salt your water**: Use enough salt so it tastes like the sea

## The Final Touch

Once our pasta is shaped, we cook it in abundantly salted boiling water for just 2-3 minutes. Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried, so timing is everything.

We finish our pasta by tossing it directly in our sauce with a splash of pasta water. This creates that restaurant-quality glossy finish that makes the sauce cling perfectly to every strand.

## Try It at Home
